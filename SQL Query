/*
	6. Which do you think is more helpful - hints or videos? Explain your reasoning.
*/
/* 
	Answer = Looking through the data, video is statistically more effective and more helpful. Based on the first table, which shows the total actions, the frequency of user using video is smaller which means that user able to understand the assignment as soon as watch the video. While based on the second table, it can be seen through the success rate of each action, that might not be 100% accurate, but it shows that video has bigger success rate. Therefore video is more helpful for users.
